## Interactive Dashboard for the Visualization of Pending Judicial Cases in India

India's judicial landscape is characterised by an overwhelming backlog of cases spanning various levels, from the Supreme Court to lower district courts.

Through interactive visualisations, this project highlights key insights, including the duration of case delays, categorization of cases as civil or criminal, the specific stage at which each case is pending, the underlying reasons for the backlog, and a breakdown of pending cases filed by women. By employing advanced data visualisation techniques, this project aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the challenges and complexities surrounding the Indian judicial system, thereby facilitating informed discussions and targeted interventions for effective resolution.

The interactive dashboard web app has been made using Streamlit which is an open-source framework for creating web-apps for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
